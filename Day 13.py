Canada has three national holidays which fall on the same dates each year

JANUARY 1 = New year's day
JULY 1 = Canada day
December 25 = Christmas day

Write a program that reads a month and day from the user.
If the month and day match one of the holidays listed previously then your program should display the holidayâ€™s name.
Otherwise your program should indicate that the entered month and day do not correspond to a fixed-date holiday.

Canada has two additional national holidays, Good Friday and Labour Day, whose dates vary from year to year.
There are also numerous provincial and territorial holidays, some of which have fixed dates,
and some of which have variable dates. We will not consider any of these additional holidays in this exercise.
