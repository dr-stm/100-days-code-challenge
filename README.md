# 100-days-code-challenge
This repository is a diary, an archive, a journal, a documentary, and more.

It is my folder where I will save all the files of my daily code activities on this challenge with [chimaihueze]([(https://github.com/chimaihueze)])

The 100 days challenge is on coding with python programming language.
It will begin today, 1st June 2022 and the repository will grow as I code.

Cheers,
Dr. STM
